Renewable Energy Trends and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Analysis (2018-2022)

üìä Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of global energy consumption trends, renewable energy adoption, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions during the 2018-2022 period. The study examines correlations between economic development, energy transition, and environmental impact at global, regional, and national scales.
Key Research Questions

Which countries are the largest consumers of renewable energy, both in absolute volume and as a proportion of their energy mix?
What regional and annual trends are emerging in renewable energy consumption?
How does the share of renewable energy in total consumption vary across countries and continents?
Is there a verifiable correlation between increased renewable energy and reduced CO‚ÇÇ emissions?
What do projections reveal about renewable energy consumption and its effects on emissions for the 2023-2027 period?

üîç Key Findings

Uneven growth of renewable energies: Overall increase of 11.51% between 2018 and 2022, reaching 25.05% of the global energy mix, with regional disparities ranging from 49.75% in South America to only 11.46% in the Middle East.
Variable correlations: Diverse relationships between renewable energy development and CO‚ÇÇ emission reduction by region: encouraging negative correlations in Europe (-0.69) and Oceania (-1.00), but paradoxical positive correlations in South America (+0.98) and Asia (+0.99).
Persistent dominance of fossil fuels: Fossil fuels still represent 68.94% of the global energy mix in 2022, with coal remaining the primary energy source (31.1%).
Strong link between economic development and energy consumption: High global correlation between GDP and energy consumption (0.89), with progressive decoupling in certain developed regions like Europe (0.40).
Contrasting 2023-2027 outlook: Expected increase in renewable energies across all regions (from +3.4% to +10.7%), but highly disparate evolution of CO‚ÇÇ emissions (from -3.3% in Europe to +33.9% in North America).

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Python and several data science libraries:

pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for visualizations
scikit-learn for predictive models and trend analysis
statsmodels for statistical analysis and correlations

Data was sourced from reliable international sources including the International Energy Agency, BP Statistical Review, IRENA, and the World Bank.
üîÆ Strategic Recommendations
The analysis concludes with targeted recommendations for three categories of actors:
For policymakers (Impact 7-9/10)

Establish binding energy transition targets (40% renewables by 2030)
Implement carbon pricing policies ($50/ton)
Strengthen financial support for the transition (tripling public investments)

For businesses (Impact 6-9/10)

Invest in R&D for clean technologies
Adopt carbon neutrality strategies with clear milestones
Commit to 100% renewable electricity

For international cooperation (Impact 7-9/10)

Strengthen Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
Create a global fund for clean technology access ($100B/year)
Harmonize international standards and regulations

üåç Context and Implications
This analysis takes place within the context of the global climate emergency and the Paris Agreement objectives. It demonstrates that despite significant progress in certain regions, the current global effort remains insufficient to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C.
The next five years will be decisive for accelerating the global energy transition, requiring unprecedented coordination between all actors and regions of the world.
